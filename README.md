[TiFramework](http://xidlabs.com/) - Wrapper framework for Titanium
================================

Looking for the old chain-able library?
--------------------------------------
The previous concept of a chain-able library previous residing in this repo can now be found at: http://adamrenklint.com/projects/adamantium-js .  This is a much more thought out chain-able library than the previous TiFramework and would encourage you to visit it.  The TiFramework repo is being repurposed for something different.
